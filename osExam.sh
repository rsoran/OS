Answer all the questions.
Use the terminal to execute each command.
Each question is to be completed in the correct sequence.
Make sure you use both absolute and relative paths as specified in the questions.
You may submit your results in a word file or show them to your instructor on your terminal.
Perform the tasks on a Linux machine.


Part A: Basic System Information and Navigation
1. Display the current hostname of the system.

2. Change the system hostname to 'Linux-Admin' and verify the change by displaying the
hostname again.

Part B: User Information

3. Display the name of the user you are currently logged in as.

4. Display the current date and time.

Part C: Directory Management

5. Create a new directory named 'Linux' in your home directory using the absolute path.

6. Navigate to the 'Linux' directory using a relative path.

7. Inside the 'Linux' directory, create two subdirectories: 'Assignments' and 'Projects'.

Part D: File Operations

8. Navigate to the 'Assignments' directory using a relative path.

9. Create an empty file named 'task1.txt' inside the 'Assignments' directory using the relative
path.

10.Display the contents of 'task1.txt' (it should be empty).

11.Using redirection, add the text "This is task 1 data." into the 'task1.txt' file.

12.Display the contents of 'task1.txt' again to verify the text was added.13.Append additional text "Additional task data." to 'task1.txt' using redirection.

14.Display the file content again to confirm the appended data.

Part E: File Management

15.Create another file named 'task2.txt' inside the 'Assignments' directory using the relative
path.

16.Move 'task1.txt' from the 'Assignments' directory to the 'Projects' directory using the
absolute path.

17.Rename 'task2.txt' to 'task3.txt' inside the 'Assignments' directory using a relative path.

18.Copy 'task3.txt' from 'Assignments' to the 'Projects' directory using the absolute path.

Part F: File Deletion and Permissions

19.Remove 'task3.txt' from the 'Projects' directory using the absolute path.

20.Navigate to the 'Projects' directory using the relative path and delete the 'task1.txt' file.

Part I: Networking
25.Display the IP address of the system using the ip command. Save the result to a file
named ip_config.txt using redirection.

26.Use ping to test the network connection by pinging a public domain (e.g., ubuntu.com).

27.Use nslookup to resolve the IP address of a public domain (e.g., ubuntu.com). Save the
result to a file named nslookup_output.txt.

Part J: Search, Filter, and Alias

30.Create an alias for the clear command.


32.Use the find command to search for any file with the name task1.txt starting from
the root directory.

33.Use the grep command to search for the term "task" inside the 'task1.txt' file.

34.Use a pipeline to combine cat and grep commands to search for the word "data" in the
'task1.txt' file.

Part K: Pipelining and Redirection

35.Use a pipeline to list all files in the 'Linux/Projects' directory and search for the term
"task" using ls & grep task.

36.Redirect the output of the date command to a file named system_date.txt.

37.Append the output of the hostname command to the system_date.txt file.
